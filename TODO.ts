TODO:


# books

should have 3 content blocks
- spline => an anchor link to site.com#book-title
- front
- back

Every one of them uses one pseudo element to create the 3 missing sides
=> We can use a gradient to make the lines

a11y:
- the title will be a link to the blog post
- arrow navigation the splines, the active one should get a highlight
- tab navigation should also highlight the spline
