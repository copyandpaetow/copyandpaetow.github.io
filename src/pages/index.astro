## todo: next steps

## tasks

- add dedicated options for flickering/lines or a general "screen realism"
=> this could also be a radio group with "none"/"mild"/"full"
- settings label buttons on the remote need some kind of grouping
- vhs cassettes should have different colors weights and not color change when they were visited

## bugs

- all blocks have an outline but the tv
- the vhs slot cover cant move realistically since the background is overlaying it. We would need to create a cutout in the background
- screen modals can scroll but the default tv screen cant

## refactorings

- unify css values and calculations
=> check vh/svh etc
- update custom property names
- extract similar functionality into classes
- improve remote color and borders
- 3d elements should all be blocks
- unify 3d button components
=> make the realistic inset a class that can be adjusted with custom properties
- disable js only functionality with @media (scripting: none)

## future features
- real inset of the displays
- shadows
- add more sounds

improve remote
=> enable channel functionality
=> mute and other settings should have their own icon on the screen
=> inputting numbers should also wait a little before going to that number
  

- add more realistic buttons
=> https://codepen.io/nicolasjesenberger/pen/gOqzJed

- rotate the scene based on mouse position => this might be a little to strong, it would make more sense to do this for the background
- animate putting in a new tape
- add scenery that changes with the content of the selected tape (background stuff, colors etc) and maybe even a parallax effect
- add height with boxes and gimmicks like a 3d sandwhich (2 buns + lettuce + patty + cheese + tomatO => https://codepen.io/qub3r-001/pen/KKveNaK)
