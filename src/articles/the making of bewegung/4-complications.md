# The feature creep: Lets do more than just the minimal basics

We can leave the animation library as it is but I think we can push it a little further so it is really easy to use. In the spirit of the UX mentality, the easiest would be a drop-in replacement for the WAAPI but that means we need to update the library once more to allow

- for an array of keyframes and
- having methods to control the progress etc. from the outside.
